        desc: "If the usual touristy spots don't charm you, skip the trappings of shady money-grabbing travel operators and try experiential travel to quaint places with Izifiso. They refuse to be clubbed as a regular travel company. As interesting as its name (Izifiso in Zulu means the spirit of life that a traveller chases), so are their curated camps, treks and trails in virgin and unexplored places in West Bengal and beyond. They have on offer beach destinations (Mousuni Island), lake stays (Doladanga), Himalayan places (Gurdum), musical journeys (Joydev Kenduli), wildlife camps (Bangripossi) and others. Keeping a traveller's zest for exploration at the heart of things, Izifiso's camps are manned by trained locals and are thus perfect for a community and cultural exchange. If you're looking for luxury, then this is definitely not the scene because their camps of mud huts, tents, caravans and homestays are all about forsaking the concrete walls of the city. They've also created a new trek route from Gurdung to Gorkhay for hikers, and several bike and bicycle trails around the city.",

Note that it's the Xiaomi 12, not the Mi 12 - we'll explain why - but this is still the successor to last year's Mi 11. Going by last year's effort this could well be one of the year's best phones, and that's not even mentioning other phones in the series like the affordable Lite and the OTT Ultra model - apparently set to be joined this time by a petite Xiaomi 12X.",
