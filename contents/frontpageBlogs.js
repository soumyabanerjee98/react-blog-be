        desc: "Ahead of Arcane’s premiere, our premiere review noted that it is, essentially, extremely good YA fiction. This is the perfect way to approach the show. Like so much of YA fiction, Arcane is a story about very hot people wrecking their relationships and their own lives in ways that feel hopelessly inevitable. What makes it so compelling over the course of its now complete first season is that its characters and their passions — for each other, for fulfillment, for revenge — are what everything else stems from. It’s not a show that’s particularly concerned with world-building by way of exposition, the way so much fantasy is. Rather, it shows characters building the world — and breaking it.",

        desc: "The fan excitement over the upcoming MCU movie Spider-Man No Way Home is huge. And that is not surprising, considering Sony and Marvel are selling the movie as a sort of mini-Avengers. Apart from Tom Holland’s Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, the film also brings back several supervillains from previous Spider-Man franchises led by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Electro (Jamie Foxx), Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), and Lizard (Rhys Ifans) are confirmed to return. After the film broke several pre-release ticket sales records in North America, there are reports claiming that many are not able to book tickets to the movie as the theatre sites have crashed.",
